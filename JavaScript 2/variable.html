<!-- Variable is a container that can hold any value and we van use that value later on in our program
1) The variable name in Js should start with a letter or a underscore 
2) In Js the variable name cannot start with a numeral value 
3) Js is case sensitive as, the variable name "Ant" and "ant" will be trated as two different values because in first word the name starts with a capital letter "A" and in second word the name start with small letter "a" -->

var a = 10; var _a12 = 10; var 1a = 10;
<!-- As it is invalid because the name starts with a numeral -->

<!-- To see the output of above code we have to write the code in a console window i.e. by inspect command on a webpage then go to console tab and write the code -->
