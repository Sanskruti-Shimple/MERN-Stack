<!-- Slicing is nothing but cutting down in smaller parts in programming -->

var abc = "ThisisRandom"; abc

<!-- Grab 4 characters and print them for this we have to use slice function where the string is actually stored-->

abc.slice(0,4)
<!-- The index starts with 0 as in array  -->
abc.slice(2,6)
<!-- This is considered as random values for checking the results which we recieve is correct or not -->
